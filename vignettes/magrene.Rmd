## Install `magrene`

`R` is an open-source statistical environment which can be easily modified to enhance its functionality via packages. `r Biocpkg("magrene")` is a `R` package available via the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) repository for packages. `R` can be installed on any operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) after which you can install `r Biocpkg("magrene")` by using the following commands in your `R` session:

```{r "install", eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
      install.packages("BiocManager")
  }

BiocManager::install("magrene")

## Check that you have a valid Bioconductor installation
BiocManager::valid()
```
