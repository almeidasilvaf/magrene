The goal of `magrene` is to identify and analyze graph motifs 
in gene regulatory networks (GRNs), including lambda, V, delta, and 
bifan motifs. GRNs can be tested for motif enrichment by comparing motif
frequencies to a null distribution generated from degree-preserving 
simulated GRNs. Additionally, motif frequencies can be analyzed 
in the context of gene duplications to explore the impact of small-scale 
and whole-genome duplications on gene regulatory networks.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `magrene` using from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("magrene")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/almeidasilvaf/magrene) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("almeidasilvaf/magrene")
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('magrene')` in R. Please
run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite __magrene__.

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('magrene')}
print(citation('magrene'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the `magrene` was only made possible thanks to many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the `magrene` project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Development tools

* Continuous code testing is possible thanks to [GitHub actions](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/usethis-1-6-0/)  through `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('usethis')`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('remotes')`, and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('rcmdcheck')` customized to use [Bioconductor's docker containers](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/) and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('BiocCheck')`.
* Code coverage assessment is possible thanks to [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh) and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('covr')`.
* The [documentation website](http://almeidasilvaf.github.io/magrene) is automatically updated thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('pkgdown')`.
* The documentation is formatted thanks to `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('devtools')` and `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('roxygen2')`.

For more details, check the `dev` directory.

This package was developed using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('biocthis')`.
