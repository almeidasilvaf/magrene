Description: magrene allows the identification and analysis of graph motifs 
    in gene regulatory networks (GRNs), including lambda, V, delta, and 
    bifan motifs. GRNs can be tested for motif enrichment by comparing motif
    frequencies to a null distribution generated from degree-preserving 
    simulated GRNs. Additionally, motif frequencies can be analyzed 
    in the context of gene duplications to explore the impact of small-scale 
    and whole-genome duplications on gene regulatory networks.
